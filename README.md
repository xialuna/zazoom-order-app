# Zazoom Order App
## Overview
Inspired from the game **Good Pizza, Great Pizza**. Here customers can order online through the Zazoom app. However, as a player, we can only see the restaurant’s side of the app. That’s why, I created a client-side interface to allow users to customize &  place their orders easily.

## Current Order App
This is an extension of the zazoom app from the client's perspective and lets you pick your favorite ingredients and have it delivered right to your door.
